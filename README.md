# FF14-role-assign

A role assignment webapp with the purpsoe of livening up Final Fantasy 14 parties with buddies.

Due to FF14's job system that allows players to change jobs (and thus roles) at will, Simone quickly drafted up some code to record all the possible party combinations that she could achieve with her three other friends.
